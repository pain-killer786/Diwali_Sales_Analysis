# Diwali Sales Data Analysis - Exploratory Data Analysis

This Jupyter Notebook project focuses on the exploratory data analysis (EDA) of Diwali sales data. The analysis is centered around various factors including gender, age, marital status, state, occupation, and product category. The goal is to gain insights into sales trends and patterns during the Diwali season.

## Data Source

The dataset used for this analysis is provided in 'data.csv'. Make sure you have the dataset file (`data.csv`) available in the same directory as this Jupyter Notebook.

## Libraries Used

The following Python libraries are used for this analysis:

- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- seaborn

## Analysis Overview

The EDA in this Jupyter Notebook covers the following aspects:

1. Data Loading: Loading the Diwali sales data from the provided CSV file.
2. Data Preprocessing: Cleaning and preparing the data for analysis, including handling missing values.
3. Gender Analysis: Analyzing sales by gender, visualizing gender-based sales trends.
4. Age Analysis: Exploring sales distribution across different age groups.
5. Marital Status Analysis: Analyzing sales data based on marital status.
6. State Analysis: Examining sales patterns by state and visualizing state-wise sales.
7. Occupation Analysis: Analyzing sales based on occupation categories.
8. Product Category Analysis: Exploring sales trends for different product categories.
